1. A constructor in Java Programming is a block of code that initializes (constructs) the state and value during object creation.

2. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. One of the main use of constructor chaining is to avoid duplicate codes while having multiple constructor

3. No. We cannot call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor. 

4. If we add a return type to a constructor, then it will become a method of the class. This is the way java runtime distinguish between a normal method and a constructor.

5. a no-argument constructor is one that does not accept any arguments or parameters.

6. Let's differentiate between a default constructor and a no-argument constructor. The main difference between the two is that a default constructor will initialize fields to their default values. In contrast, a no-argument constructor will not initialize any fields.

7. The purpose of constructor overloading is to provide different ways to initialize an object of a class. The purpose of method overloading is to provide different ways to perform a specific action in a class.

8. It is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors are explicitly defined in the class.
example :
  class Default
   {
     int age;
     
     // default constructor
     // public Default()
     //   { 

       // }
   }
 
   public class Launch
   {
    public static void main(String []args)
     {
       Default d=new Default();
     }
   }
